# Enhance `formatMovie` Function for Additional Genres Key

## Description

Modify the `formatMovie` function to enhance the Movie business model by adding an additional genres key. This key must be an array of strings containing the names of the movie genres based on the `genre_ids` key of the Movie Data API. The updated `formatMovie` function should now receive, as a parameter, the JavaScript Map generated by the formatMovieGenre function.

Modifying the `formatMovie` function to include genre names as an array ensures that the enhanced Movie business model reflects the associated genres based on the `genre_ids` from the Movie Data API. This improvement enhances the richness of the Movie model.
