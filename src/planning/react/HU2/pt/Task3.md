# Create TypeScript Type for Movie Model

## Description:

Define a TypeScript type named Movie to represent the model of a movie. This type should include fields required for both UI rendering and business logic. Place the type definition in a Movie.d.ts file within the src/model folder.

Creating a TypeScript type for the movie business model helps maintain a clear structure in the application and provides type safety throughout the development process. Placing the type definition in a .d.ts file within the src/model folder ensures proper organization.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Create movie.d.ts File:

    - [ ] Create a file named Movie.d.ts within the src/model folder to store the TypeScript type definition.

- [ ] Define Movie Type:

    - [ ] Define a TypeScript type named Movie within the `Movie.d.ts` file.

    - [ ] Include fields such as title, poster, releaseYear, and any other relevant information needed for UI and business logic.

- [ ] Export Type:

    - [ ] Export the Movie type from the `movie.d.ts` file, making it accessible for other parts of the application.

## Definition of Done:

- [ ] A file named movie.d.ts is created within the src/model folder.

- [ ] The Movie type is defined within the .d.ts file, including fields for UI rendering and business logic.

- [ ] The Movie type is successfully exported from the .d.ts file.
